# fade-onscroll-jquery-plugin

On scrolling, the content will fade in giving a clean effect. You can see the dummy [here](https://fadeonscroll.000webhostapp.com/).

To use the plugin all you need to do is:
- Include the jquery script i.e. *<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js" ></script>*
- Include the fade-scroll.js file i.e. *<script src="fade-scroll.js" ></script>* (if the file is in the same directory otherwise mention complete path)
- Now to use the effect, just include the class '*fade-scroll-bottom*' to whichever html elements(div, p, img, etc.) you want to add!
